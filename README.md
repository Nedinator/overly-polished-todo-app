### Known Issues

> I'm moving on from some things to keep my flow going.

[ ] - Delete all data has some weird redirect stuff going on. I tried fixing that but still end up at the signin redirect due to settings being protected.
[ ] - Ordering with drag and drop - This is gonna wait. I want to add other things before really coming back to this.
